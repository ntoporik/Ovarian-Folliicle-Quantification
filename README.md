# Ovarian-Folliicle-Quantification
This project is intended to quantify distributin of follicular sizes in rat ovary
We will use the experimental data on follicular quantification obtained by counting size and number of follicles in rat ovaries obtained by stainig serial slices. Such slicing approach, generate some bias in follicular distribution (that is we will undercount a small folliclue and over-count the large ones). We will use this data to generate a most likely distribution of actual follicles.
